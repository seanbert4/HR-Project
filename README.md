This app could be called "Walk From Work." It tells users which businesses are within a short walk from their workplace. It tailors the results to
a handful of use cases commonly encountered during the work week. I get frustrated comparing reviews across different web sites, so I designed this
app to calculate a comprehensive rating using reviews from Yelp, Google, OpenTable, and TripAdvisor. Since offical APIs aren't available for all 
of these sources (and I need more time to learn how to use APIs -- that's next on my self-study list), I decided to just hard code the data into the app. 
I focused on the neighborhood around Hack Reactor because (a), I figured you'd get a kick out of it and (b) I could virtually explore your 
corner of the world before I get there (can't wait to try the Flying Falafel). So all of the estimated travel times assume the user is starting 
at Hack Reactor HQ.
